        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>My name is Nwangwa Iheanyi Emmanuel, a recent graduate of the University of Ibadan, where I majored in Educational Management and minored in Communication. Growing up in a humble home with my single mother, a hardworking trader, I witnessed the challenges of limited access to quality education. These experiences shaped my passion for bridging educational disparities, especially in underdeveloped communities where opportunities are scarce. I believe education is a transformative tool that can unlock potential and drive societal progress.

            My growing interest in technology, particularly ed-tech, has inspired me to focus on creating accessible, user-friendly platforms to make education available to all. To achieve this, I am pursuing the Software Engineering program at AltSchool Africa, specializing in Front-End development. My goal is to combine my educational background with technical skills to design impactful solutions that empower learners in underserved regions, contributing to a more equitable and inclusive educational landscape.</p>
